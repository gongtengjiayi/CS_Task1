It was all very well to say 'Drink me,' but the wise little Alice wasnot going to do THAT in a hurry. 'No, I'll look first,' she said, 'andsee whether it's marked "poison" or not'; for she had read several nicelittle histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wildbeasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not rememberthe simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hotpoker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut yourfinger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had neverforgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked 'poison,' it isalmost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.
